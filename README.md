## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I learned that I can center all content in the body by doing this:

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to start using Grid in new projects to practice all the awesome features it brings to the table.

### Useful resources

- [Pixel Parallel Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/pixelparallel-by-htmlburg/iffnoibnepbcloaaagchjonfplimpkob/related?hl=en) - This awesome Chrome extension can be used to compare an image design with how it is looking on the web.
